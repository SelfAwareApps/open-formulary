The most important\r\nfactor for diagnosing breast cancer appears to be the age at which\r\nthe contraceptive is stopped rather than the duration of use; any\r\nincrease in the rate of diagnosis diminishes gradually during the\r\n10 years after stopping and disappears by 10 yearsCervical cancer\u00a0Use of combined oral contraceptives\r\nfor 5 years or longer is associated with a small increased risk of\r\ncervical cancer; the risk diminishes after stopping and disappears\r\nby about 10 years. The risk of cervical cancer with transdermal patches\r\nand vaginal rings is not yet knownNote\u00a0The possible small increase in the risk of\r\nbreast cancer and cervical cancer should be weighed against the protective\r\neffect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium",
